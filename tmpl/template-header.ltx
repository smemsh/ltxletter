% changes to make if editing this as a template are after
% the \begin{letter} (near the end)

\documentclass{letter}
\pagestyle{empty}

\usepackage{wasysym}
\usepackage{parskip}

% ADJUST as needed
\usepackage[margin=25mm]{geometry}

% ADJUST for signature indentation
\longindentation=0pt

\begin{document}

	% the default is just far too small to read, I can't
	% understand why it's the default
	\fontfamily{cmss}

	% ADJUST as needed
	\fontsize{13}{15}
	\selectfont

        % inter-paragraph skip
	% this is needed in combination with parskip
	% package...the inter-paragraph space still isn't
	% enough even with the parskip package.  But that
	% package does help the enumerated lists and such
	% with 0pt paragraph indents, so it's needed beyond
	% simply changing parskip and parsep.
	% ADJUST as needed
	\advance \parskip by 5pt

	\begin{letter}
		%
		% \name does not line up with address for
		% some reason so we have to actually include
		% it in address and leave name blank... this
		% is a hack but seems to work.
		%
		% ADJUST as needed:
		% - newlines
		% - name and address in \address and \opening
		%
		\name		{}
		\address	{
				  Your Name\\
				  1234 Sender Rd, City, ST 56789 }
		\opening	{
				  Recipient Name, Recipient Place \\
				  123 Destination Rd \#45, City, ST 67890 \\
				  \\
				  \\
				  Mr. Recipient,
				}
		\input		{ __M4SUB_ESCAPED_NAME__}
		\closing	{
				  \mbox{Thanks for your help,}
				  \signature {Your Name}
